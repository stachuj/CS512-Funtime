## 6. Retrospective

What went well:

We communicated better throughout this sprint than others. This was due to an early planning meeting and constant messsaging through Discord that kept everyone on track. 

All pieces came together to complete the final product. We didn't have any parts that we couldn't integrate by the deadline like in some past sprints.

What could be improved:

We could improve on completing things ahead of time rather than finishing up last minute. This can help avoid any confusion on what is left to be completed.
